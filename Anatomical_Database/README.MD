## Anatomical Database
Acoustic scattering models that are applied to marine and freshwater animals often require digital representations of their morphometry and anatomy. echoSMs has developed a database for digital reprepesntations of fish and zooplankton. We provide code and the schema for providing data to the database and for those data to be input to acoustic scattering models.

The folders are arranged as:
- **Schema**
- **Example Data Files**
